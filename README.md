# Alibaba Plus Clone

This project is a solid copy of alibaba.com/plus and it's only meant for educational purpose so all rights reserved to Alibaba.com.

In this project I worked with couple of modules for instance SwiperJs and Tailwindcss,
I used the original Alibaba APIs and All the content you see is recieved from the original server. :)
